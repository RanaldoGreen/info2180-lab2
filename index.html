                        <h2>Rottweiler</h2>
                        <p class="publisher">September 07, 2022 by Chloe<p>

                            Although there is no documentation of the Rottweiler's origins, 
                            most people think the breed descended from the herding dogs of ancient Rome. 
                            Throughout their long history, they've been used to perform many different jobs.
                            In the past when the Roman empire was expanding, it needed a way of feeding massive traveling armies of men. 
                            They used their dogs to herd livestock and march them along with the army. 
                            This was the only viable way for the soldiers to have a steady food supply without refrigeration. 
                            Today the Rottweiler participants in herding events, and can keep up with the sheepdogs and shepherds in the field.
                            <br></br>
                            By the mid-1800s, the Rottweiler had fallen out of favor. Dog carts had been replaced by donkey carts and then railroads.
                            Cattle droving was outlawed, leaving Rottweilers with no work. 
                            However the breed bounced back in the early 1900s when it gained popularity as a police dog. 
                            When World War I hit in 1914, Rottweilers served with German police officers. 
                            Becoming the fourth dog breed to be officially recognized as a police dog. 
                            Around this same time, Rotts came to be recognized as official military dogs. 
                            This opened up other doors for Rotties in working positions. 
                            They even became one of the first dog breeds to be trained as guide dogs for visually impaired people.
